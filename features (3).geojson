        "Recommended Improvement Measures": "\"Improvement Measure TR-2: Queue Abatement Conditions of Approval The owner/operator of the off-street parking facility shall ensure that recurring vehicle queues do not occur on the public right-of-way. A vehicle queue is defined as one or more vehicles (destined for the parking facility) blocking any portion of any public street, alley or sidewalk for a consecutive period of three minutes or longer on a daily or weekly basis. If a recurring queue occurs, the owner/operator of the parking facility shall employ abatement methods as needed to abate the queue. Suggested abatement methods include but are not limited to the following: redesign of facility to improve vehicle circulation and/or on-site queue capacity; employment of parking attendants; use of valet parking or other space-efficient parking techniques; use of off-site parking facilities or shared parking with nearby uses; use of parking occupancy sensors and signage directing drivers to available spaces; or travel demand management strategies such as additional bicycle parking. If the Planning Director, or his or her designee, suspects that a recurring queue is present, the Planning Department shall notify the property owner in writing. Upon request, the owner/operator shall hire a qualified transportation consultant to evaluate the conditions at the site for no less than seven days. The consultant shall prepare a monitoring report to be submitted to the Planning Department for review. If the Planning Department determines that a recurring queue does exist, the facility owner/operator shall have 90 days from the date of the written determination to abate the queue.\"",
